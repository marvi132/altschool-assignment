# 🧪 Task 1 – Extract

Use `sql/retail_data.sql` to set up the database in PostgreSQL or Dbeaver.

### 🧩 Your Tasks:

1. Run the SQL script to create and populate tables.
2. Write SQL queries to answer the following:
   - Top 5 customers by total amount spent
   - Number of orders placed by each customer
   - Products that have never been ordered

### 💾 Export the results:

Save your query results as `.csv` files in the `results/` folder:

- `top_customers.csv`
- `orders_per_customer.csv`
- `unsold_products.csv`

📝 Document your SQL queries in the same file or as a `.sql` script if preferred.
