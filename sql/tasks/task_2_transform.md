# 🧪 Task 2 – Transform

Use Python (no pandas) to clean the exported data.

### 🎯 Your Goal:
- Write a script in `scripts/transform.py` that:
  1. Reads `results/top_customers.csv`
  2. Converts all customer names to **title case**
  3. Formats amount spent as Nigerian currency (₦1,000.00 format)
  4. Saves the output as `results/top_customers_cleaned.csv`

🛠️ Use only built-in libraries like `csv` or `open()` for file handling.
